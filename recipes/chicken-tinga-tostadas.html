        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Chicken tinga tostadas are crispy corn tortillas topped with shredded chicken simmered in a smoky tomato-chipotle sauce, garnished with lettuce, queso fresco, avocado, and crema.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 bone-in chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>7 medium onions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>6 medium tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules</li>
            <li>16 tostada shells</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the chicken into a large pot along with 1/4 cup of sliced onion, garlic, and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until no longer pink, about 25 minutes. Remove chicken, cool, and shred meat. Discard skin and bones.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the remaining onion slices, and fry until transparent. Place tomatoes into a pan of boiling water (you could use the leftover chicken water), and boil until they split open.</li>
            <li>Place the tomatoes, the whole can of chipotle peppers, chicken bouillon into a blender or large food processor. Process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Pour this mixture into a large pan, and add the shredded chicken and cooked onions. Heat through.</li>
            <li>To serve, each person spreads some sour cream on their tostada shell, and tops with a spoonful of the chicken.</li>
        </ol>
